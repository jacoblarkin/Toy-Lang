# Toy-Lang

Toy stack based programming language (WIP)

## Intro

I am building this as a toy to experiment with. Eventually it will be ported to C,
but for now Python is sufficient and allows me to develop functionality quickly.

## List of Commands

+ '+': add top two elements of stack
+ '-': negate top element on stack
+ '<>': swap top two elements of stack
+ 'p': print top element of stack
+ 'p!': pop top element from stack and print
+ 'pa': print whole stack
+ '.': define a custom command
